Scripts to unattended install packages on a newly installed Operating System.
I mainly used this scripts when i was setting up some virtual machines, which i wanted them to have exactly the same set of packages.

Feel free to modify the packages lists inside my scripts.You can also change the list names or even make your own lists, so as to install the packages that fit best for you.
